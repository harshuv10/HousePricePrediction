Importing Libraries: The script starts by importing necessary libraries. matplotlib.pyplot is imported for visualization, and presumably, pandas for data manipulation and numpy for mathematical operations.

Reading the Dataset: It reads a CSV file named "HousingData.csv" into a DataFrame called dataset using pd.read_csv().

Data Exploration: It then displays the first few rows of the dataset using dataset.head() and provides information about the dataset using dataset.info() and dataset.describe().

Data Preparation: It selects specific columns ('Avg. Area Income', 'Avg. Area House Age', 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms', 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms') as features (X) and the 'Price' column as the target variable (y).

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection. It uses 70% of the data for training (X_train, y_train) and 30% for testing (X_test, y_test).

Model Training: It initializes a linear regression model using LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model and fits it to the training data using lm.fit(X_train, y_train).

Making Predictions: It predicts the target variable for the test set using lm.predict(X_test).

Visualization: It creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the actual prices (y_test) and the predicted prices (predictions).

Evaluation Metrics: Finally, it calculates and prints three evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) using functions from sklearn.metrics and math.
